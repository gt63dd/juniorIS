annote  = {This is a popular algorithms textbook which is well-cited. In particular, Part VI on graph algorithms will be of interest. Chapter 26 discusses flow networks and introduces commonly used notation. It formally describes the problem of obtaining a maximum flow and its equivalence to obtaining a minimum cut. The classical method of Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for finding a maximum flow is described, and it includes several examples. Additional methods for obtaining a maximum flow, including the push-relabel method, are also described. The chapter notes include additional references to specific articles which may be helpful, such as those of historical interest (the article in which an algorithm was originally proposed) as well as state-of-the-art improvements (more recent articles to improve the approach).}

abstract = {Domestic undergraduate computer science students formally learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence in upper level undergraduate computing programs, yet they must navigate the lure of ChatGPT and other generative Artificial Intelligence tools that have been found to be somewhat accurate at completing early coding assignments. As AI tools proliferate, messaging about their use in academic settings are varied, and access to AI literacy is unknown. Through an investigation of interviews with Pell grant eligible college students at open access colleges, we address the following research questions: How do low-income undergraduate interview participants describe their uses of and attitudes regarding generative AI tool use for academic purposes? and What elements of AI digital literacy appear to be accessible to interview participants, based on their descriptive statements?},

abstract = {Web bots vary in sophistication based on their purpose, ranging from simple automated scripts to advanced web bots that have a browser fingerprint, support the main browser functionalities, and exhibit a humanlike behaviour. Advanced web bots are especially appealing to malicious web bot creators, due to their browserlike fingerprint and humanlike behaviour that reduce their detectability. This work proposes a web bot detection framework that comprises two detection modules: (i) a detection module that utilises web logs, and (ii) a detection module that leverages mouse movements. The framework combines the results of each module in a novel way to capture the different temporal characteristics of the web logs and the mouse movements, as well as the spatial characteristics of the mouse movements. We assess its effectiveness on web bots of two levels of evasiveness: (a) moderate web bots that have a browser fingerprint and (b) advanced web bots that have a browser fingerprint and also exhibit a humanlike behaviour. We show that combining web logs with visitors’ mouse movements is more effective and robust toward detecting advanced web bots that try to evade detection, as opposed to using only one of those approaches.},

abstract = {Web bots are vital for the web as they can be used to automate several actions, some of which would have otherwise been impossible or very time consuming. These actions can be benign, such as website testing and web indexing, or malicious, such as unauthorised content scraping, scalping, vulnerability scanning, and more. To detect malicious web bots, recent approaches examine the visitors’ fingerprint and behaviour. For the latter, several values (i.e., features) are usually extracted from visitors’ web logs and used as input to train machine learning models. In this research we show that web bots can use recent advances in machine learning, and, more specifically, Reinforcement Learning (RL), to effectively evade behaviour-based detection techniques. To evaluate these evasive bots, we examine (i) how well they can evade a pre-trained bot detection framework, (ii) how well they can still evade detection after the detection framework is re-trained on new behaviours generated from the evasive web bots, and (iii) how bots perform if re-trained again on the re-trained detection framework. We show that web bots can repeatedly evade detection and adapt to the re-trained detection framework to showcase the importance of considering such types of bots when designing web bot detection frameworks.},
